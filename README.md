# Phishing-Link-Simulation-and-Detection
This project focuses on the simulation and detection of phishing links to help understand how phishing attacks are constructed and how they can be identified, analyzed, and mitigated in real-world environments. The primary goal is to support cybersecurity education, awareness, and defensive research.

The project simulates common phishing techniques in a controlled and ethical manner to study attacker behavior, URL manipulation patterns, and user deception methods. It also explores detection strategies that can be used by security teams to identify suspicious links before they cause harm.

This repository is intended for:

Cybersecurity learning and training

Threat modeling and analysis

Blue team / defensive security research

Awareness and prevention of social engineering attacks
